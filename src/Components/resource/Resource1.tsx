              Key Components of the Maternal Health Policy Reform 2025:
            </h1>
            <ul className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 list-disc pl-4">
              <li>Maternal Care Standards: CMS is introducing new baseline health and safety requirements for obstetrical services in hospitals and critical access hospitals for the first time. These standards, a core element of the 2025 maternal health reforms, will set guidelines for staffing, care delivery, and emergency preparedness.</li>
              <li>Health Equity Measures: As part of the policy changes for maternal care, the proposal aims to expand quality program measure sets for hospital outpatient, ASC, and rural emergency hospital programs to include equity-focused metrics.</li>
              <li>Support for Tribal Health: The Maternal Health Policy Reform 2025 includes an add-on payment to the All-Inclusive Rate (AIR) for certain Indian Health Services (IHS) and tribal facilities. This aims to increase access to high-cost drugs, particularly benefiting cancer care services in these communities.</li>
              <li>Medicaid Flexibility: Exceptions to the Medicaid clinic services “four walls” requirement are proposed, potentially increasing access to care in tribal, rural, and behavioral health settings – a crucial aspect of the 2025 maternal health reforms.</li>
